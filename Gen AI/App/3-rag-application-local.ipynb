For example, between 2021 and 2022, \\nthe labor market continued to improve, which may \\nhave affected private coverage in the United States \\nduring that time.1 Public policy changes included \\nthe renewal of the Public Health Emergency, which \\nallowed Medicaid enrollees to remain covered under \\nthe Continuous Enrollment Provision.2 The American \\nRescue Plan (ARP) enhanced Marketplace premium \\nsubsidies for those with incomes above 400 percent \\nof the poverty level as well as for unemployed people.3\\nIn addition to national policies, individual states and \\nthe District of Columbia can affect health insurance \\ncoverage by making Marketplace or Medicaid more \\naccessible and affordable. This variation may be \\nmore or less pronounced across states. Missouri and \\nOklahoma expanded Medicaid eligibility under the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in \\n2022, leaving only twelve states without expanded \\nMedicaid eligibility, primarily in the South and parts \\n1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported increases in national \\nemployment from 2021 to 2022. More information is available at \\n<www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2023/article/unemployment-rate-returned-\\nto-its-prepandemic-level-in-2022.htm>.\\n2 Juliette Cubanski et al., “What Happens When COVID-19 \\nEmergency Declarations End? Implications for Coverage, Costs, and \\nAccess?,” Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023, <www.kff.org/coronavirus-\\ncovid-19/issue-brief/what-happens-when-covid-19-emergency-\\ndeclarations-end-implications-for-coverage-costs-and-access/>.\\n3 For more information, refer to the American Rescue Plan Act, \\nP.L. 117-2, March 11, 2021, <www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/\\nhouse-bill/1319/text>.\\nof the Midwest.4, 5 Kentucky, Maine, and New Mexico \\ncreated state-based health insurance marketplaces on \\nNovember 1, 2021, to replace their previously federally \\nrun exchanges.6 State and federal policies designed to \\nincrease public coverage may also affect the supply \\nand demand for private coverage. As a result, a variety \\nof changes in coverage rates are possible. \\nThis brief uses the 2021 and 2022 American \\nCommunity Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates to exam-\\nine differences in health insurance coverage status \\nand select subtypes (Medicaid, direct purchase, \\nand employer-based) for the 50 states, the District \\nof Columbia, and the 25 most populous metro-\\npolitan areas (refer to the “What Is Health Insurance \\nCoverage?” text box).7 It also examines year-to-year \\nchanges (2021 to 2022) across these geographies. \\n4 Note that for the purposes of this brief, we consider a state \\nto have expanded Medicaid eligibility if it expanded eligibility on \\nor before January 1st of that expansion year. For a state to have \\nexpanded Medicaid eligibility in 2022, it would have had to expand \\neligibility after January 1, 2021, but before January 1, 2022.
